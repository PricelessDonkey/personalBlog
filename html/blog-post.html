            <p class="post-text">Anyhow here is a random excerpt from Henry Miller's book titled
                <em>"Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch"</em>: With this setup i am almost as familiar
                as Jean Wharton who has spent so much time, so much effort, developing positives for those who see only
                negatives,
                or rather are unable to read negatives, for if they could they would have no more need
                for positives than for negatives.

            <p class="post-text">Why is it we cannot hold the positive, once it has been shown us?
                The answers are many, varying with school and dogma. In any case, do we not resemble those myopic
                individuals who, durin ga train ride in which they have fallen sound asleep,
                their spectacles safely in their pockets, suddenly open their eyes and, for a fraction of time, see
                everything sharp
                and clear, as sharp and clear as if they enjoyed perfect vision?
            </p>
            <p class="post-text"><em>Let us not quibble</em>. Their vision <i>was</i> perfect -- for just
                a few instants. What made it so? Do they ask themselves the question? No! They
                calmly wipe their eyes, now blurred again, and put on their specs. With these, so they tell
                themselves, they can see as well as the next man.

            <p class="post-text">Well - that's all i've got from Henry Miller. Pretty cool writer. His books
                are kind of about nothing and everything all at once.
